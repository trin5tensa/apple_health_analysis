@dataclass
class TimeCategories:
    """
    Support the conversion of matplotlib date ranges into matplotlib categories. The categories are
    represented by 'buckets' of date sequences. They are identified by the last date in the bucket.
    
    The buckets are aligned with the end_date. Since this could lead to the first bucket containing less
    than the full number of days defined by 'bucket_size' the 'start_date' is normalized to the
    beginning of the first complete bucket.
    For example, with start date = 2021-12-10, end_date = 2021-12-15, bucket_size = 4 the start date
    will be normalized to 2021-12-12.
    Also with start date = 2021-12-10, end_date = 2021-12-15, bucket_size = 6 the start date
    will be unchanged at 2121-12-10.

    Usage within matplotlib/seaborn:
        # Create a TimeCategories object
        start = pandas.Timestamp(2021, 11, 26)
        end = pandas.Timestamp(2021, 12, 5)
        bucket_size = 3
        time_categories = TimeCategories(start, end, bucket_size)
